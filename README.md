Festo/Codesys(2.3) Project :

***FESTO project***: Assembly line, used to assemble a finite product composed by a body, a piston ,a spring and a cap. The finite product can have the body red, black or silver. If the body is black the corresponding piston will be silver otherwise black.

The assembly line is composed by four different stations: DISTRIBUTION SECTION --> In which the body is taken from the warehouse and distributed to the testing station; the TESTING STATION --> in which there are different sensors to verify the presence and measure the height of the object, if the height is not correct the part is discarded; PTOCESSING STATION --> After the various tests the piece arrives on a rotary table where is drilled by a drill; finally we have the ASSEMBLY LINE --> in which a robot assembles all the parts of the finite product and discardes the wrong products.
